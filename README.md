<p align="center"> üì± A tool for automating interactions with Android devices - including ADB, AndroGuard, and Frida interactivity. ‚¨áÔ∏è </p>

<br>

AutoDroid is a Python tool for programmatically scripting bulk interactions with one or more Android devices. Possible uses include:
- Downloading and extracting all APKs from all connected devices. ‚öôÔ∏è
- Testing a developed application on multiple devices at once. üì≤
- Testing potential malware against a suite of AV products. ‚ò¢Ô∏è

# üí™ Getting Started
To use AutoDroid you will need to install the dependencies, these are specified in the requirements file and can be installed by following the below command.

```bash
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

AutoDroid needs to be provided a valid Json configuration file as a command line argument. The below shows a simple configuration file example that will retrieve all applications from all connected devices one at a time and extract the APKs to zips using AndroGuard.

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": ["adb pull !app_path !app_id.apk","reverse: !app_id.apk"]
}
```

Once you have created a valid AutoDroid configuration file you can begin device interaction by running the ```AutoDroid.py``` python file with the configuration file as it's command line parameter.

```bash
python AutoDroid.py example_config.json
```
# üß± Commands and blocks
The AutoDroid configuration file can be provided with a series of commands to execute on the target devices, these commands are run locally on your machine and so the programs and files being called must be present. These commands can be in either a list format (as can be seen in the example above) or as a key value pair map/ dict. These key value pairs are defined as blocks of commands, where the key is the block name and the value is a list of commands. The constant (described below) ```block:<block name>``` can be used to run a block and provides a simple loop/ call-back feature. An example of using blocks can be seen below.

```json 
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": {
      "test_user_input":["adb -s !device_id shell monkey -v 5 -p !app_id"],
      "retrieve_apk":["adb -s !device_id pull !app_path !app_id.apk","sleep:5"]
    }
}
```

# üì± Devices and apps
Two additional fields that are instrumental to AutoDroid are the ```devices``` and ```apps``` fields. These fields define the adb device ID for the device(s) being targeted (a list of strings) and the application reverse domain notation name (i.e. ```com.example.application```) for the applications being targeted on the device (a list of strings). Both of these fields can be empty, a list of strings, or defined as ```*``` where all available devices and apps will be targeted. In the backend the way this works is when a value is provided in these fields the program will loop through all commands in order for each application on each device. An example of specifying a specific device and app can be seen below:

```json
{
  "devices": ["09261JEC216934"],
    "apps": ["com.google.android.networkstack.tethering"],
    "commands": ["adb -s !device_id pull !app_path !app_id.apk"]
}
```

When the devices field is not empty (i.e. not ```"devices":[],```) a variable (see below) of ```!device_id``` is created. This variable can be used in your commands to denote the ADB device ID for the current targeted device. Similarly the variables ```!app_id```, and ```!app_path``` are added when the app field is not empty and can be used in commands to define the app reverse domain notation name and the path to that application's APK file.

# üì£ Variables
To save time, AutoDroid allows for an infinite amount of variables to be set in a script. These variables are constructed in a key value pair format. When the key of a variable is located in a command it will be replaced for the value. An example configuration that utilises variables can be seen below, in this configuration file the variable ```!test``` has been added as short hand for a ```monkey``` adb command and the built-in variable ```!app_id``` is also used. 

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "variables": {"!test": "adb -s !device_id shell monkey -v 500 -p"},
    "commands": ["!test !app_id"]
}
```

The preferred standard for using variables is to precede them with a ```!``` and to use ```_``` instead of spaces. 

## Reserved Variables 
The below is a list of reserved variables that are already used in AutoDroid and should be avoided from adding to your config file. If these variables are added they will be overwritten at runtime.
-	```!device_id``` - When one or more devices are provided in the config, this variable is populated at runtime. And is set as the ADB device ID for the current device. Each device is looped through in turn with the configured commands being run for each device.
-	```!adb_connect``` ‚Äì This is a shorthand variable that translates to ```adb -s !device_id```, using this instead of ```adb``` will insure that all adb commands are run on the correct device.
-	```!app_id``` - When one or more apps are provided in the config, this variable is populated at runtime. And is set as the application reverse domain notation name (i.e. ```com.example.myapplication```) for the current application. Each application is looped through in turn with the configured commands being run for each app.
-	```!app_path``` - Similar to the above. When one or more apps are provided in the config, this variable is populated at runtime. And is set as the path to the current application APK file on the target device. Each application is looped through in turn with the configured commands being run for each app.

# üì¢ Constants
Constants are commands specific to AutoDroid and relate to specific functionality. Normally broken down into a keyword followed by a ```:``` and then one or more parameters separated by a ```;```. These constants must be used at the start of a command and should always be in lower case. Examples will be given in the individual sections.

## Frida 
AutoDroid has built in functionality to run Frida JavaScript files as part of an AutoDroid run. This constant is defined as ```frida:``` and must be provided the path to the JavaScript file being used, followed by a ```;``` and then the application reverse notation name of the application being targeted. In addition to applying variables to the command, variables are also applied to the contents of the file provided. 

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": ["frida:myJavascript.js;!app_id"]
}
```

***note*** while the Frida integration is implemented, it is currently untested. 

## AndroGuard 
AutoDroid supports reverse engineering APKs via AndroGuard. This constant is structured as ```reverse:``` and takes a path to a locally stored APK. Using this will save an unbundled version of the APK as a ZIP with the name ```<application name>.apk```.

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": ["adb -s !device_id pull !app_path !app_id.apk","reverse: !app_id.apk"]
}
```

When using the reverse constant the apk path can be followed by any number of paramiters (seperated by a ```;```), these including ```info``` (which will save a Json file of application information, ```decompile``` (which on Linux will save a txt summary of the decompiled methods), ```manifest``` (which will save the xml manifest file, and ```zip``` which will perform the same action as if no paramiters were provided and saves the unbundled APK to a zip file. An example of using these parameters can be seen below:

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": {
      "get_app": ["adb -s !device_id pull !app_path !app_id.apk"],
      "reverse_app":["reverse: !app_id.apk;info",
                     "reverse: !app_id.apk;manifest;decompile"]
    }
}
```

## Sleep 
This constant provides simple functionality for pausing execution of the tooling for a specific amount of time. This constant is structured as ```sleep:``` followed by the amount of seconds to wait.

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": ["adb pull !app_path !app_id.apk","sleep:5"]
}
```

## Block
The block constant provides simple looping and call-back functionality. This constant is structured as ```block:``` followed by the name of the block of commands to execute. If no blocks have been provided (i.e. commands have been provided in a list format), then commands are added to a block called ```main```.

```json 
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": {
      "test_user_input":["adb shell monkey -v 5 -p !app_id"],
      "retrieve_apk":["adb pull !app_path !app_id.apk"],
      "test_again": ["block: test_user_input","sleep:5"]
    }
}
```

# üìö More complex configs
## Malware Analysis
The below is an example of using AutoDroid to test potential malware on Android devices. This config installs the potential malware, records the screen, retrieves the screen capture, and uninstalls the application.

```json 
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": [],
    "commands": {
      "record_screen": ["adb shell screenrecord /data/local/tmp/test.mp4 --time-limit 120"],
      "install_eicar":["adb install com.fsecure.eicar.antivirus.test.apk"],
      "user_input":["adb shell monkey -p com.fsecure.eicar.antivirus.test -v 1","sleep: 20"],
      "uninstall": ["adb uninstall com.fsecure.eicar.antivirus.test"],
      "get_video": ["adb pull /data/local/tmp/test.mp4", "sleep: 20","adb shell rm /data/local/tmp/test.mp4"]
    }
}
```

## Application Reverse Engineering
The below is an example of using AutoDroid's implementation of AndroGuard to reverse engineering an APK off a device and retrieve a json of info about the app, a decompiled summary of methods, the xml manifest file, and an unbundled zip file of the APK.

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["me.jamesstevenson.onelist"],
    "commands": {
      "get_app": ["adb pull !app_path !app_id.apk"],
      "reverse_app":["reverse: !app_id.apk;info;decompile;manifest;zip"]
    }
}
```
