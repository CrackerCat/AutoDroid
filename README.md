<p align="center"> ðŸ“± A tool for automating interactions with Android devices - including ADB, AndroGuard, and Frida interactivity.  ðŸ“¦</p>

<br>

AutoDroid is a Python tool for programatically scripting bulk interactions with an Android device, possibly use cases include:
- Downloading and extracting all APKs from all connected devices.
- Testing a developed application on a multiple devices at once.
- Testing potential malware against a suite of AV products.

# Getting Started
First things first you will need to install the dependancies of AutoDroid, these are specified in the requirements file and can be installed by following the below command.

```bash
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

AutoDroid needs to be provided a valid Json configuration file as a command line argument. The below shows a simple configuration file example that will retrieve all applications from all connected devices one at a time and extract the APKs to zips using AndroGuard.

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "commands": ["adb pull !app_path !app_id.apk","reverse: !app_id.apk"]
}
```

Once you have created a valid AutoDroid configuration file you can begin device interaction by running the ```AutoDroid.py``` python file with the configuration file as it's command line paramiter.

```bash
python AutoDroid.py config.json
```






An example config can be seen below:

```json
{
  "devices": ["*"],
    "apps": ["*"],
    "variables": {},
    "commands": {
      "begining": ["adb -s !device_id shell monkey -p !app_id 1"],
      "middle": ["adb  -s !device pull !app_path !app_id.apk"],
      "end": ["reverse: !app_id.apk"],
      "again": ["block:begining"]
    }
}

```


### Config fields
The Json config contains several paramiters for configuring an interaction with a device.
- apps - This field defines what applications the tooling targets. This can be empty, a list of reverse notation paths such as ```com.example.application```, or ```*``` which will target all applications on the device. When using this the ```app_path``` and ```app_id``` variables are added to the variable list.
- devices - This field defines what devices the tooling targets over adb. This can be empty, a list of device IDs, or ```*``` which will target all connected devices. When using this the ```!device_id``` variable is added to variables and can be used to access the device id.
- variables - This is a map of key value pairs. During execution of commands all keys will be replaced with their values. I.e. adding ```{"!script":"ls"}``` will replace the ```!script``` string with ```ls``` in all commands.  
- commands - A dictionary or list of blocks to be executed. If a list is provided it is defined as a block with name ```name```. Outside of this a map can be provided with keys for the command block name and the value being a list of commands to execute. In addition to this a command can be started with ```block:``` to run anouther block provided after the ```:```, ```reverse:``` to run AndroGuard on an APK on the path after the ```:```, and ```Frida:``` followed by the Javascript file a ```;``` and the package name to use a frida javascript script.
